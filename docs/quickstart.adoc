= Quick start

== Installation

Make sure there is a Rust environment installed. Otherwise follow the
https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html[Rust installation guide].

[source,shell]
----
cargo install --git https:/github.com/riboseinc/riffol
----

This command will build a `riffol` binary and store it in the `bin`
directory under `$CARGO_HOME` - usually `~/.cargo/bin/riffol`.

== Usage

 riffol [-f config-file]

Riffol requires a configuration file. The default location of this
file is `/etc/riffol.conf`.

This location can be specified either via the `RIFFOL_CONFIG`
environment variable or by using the `-f` command line flag.
