= Riffol

Riffol is a supervising process that can run as a traditional daemon on
Unix-like systems or as an `init` system for containers
(such as https://github.com/krallin/tini[tini]).

Riffol can be configured by creating application groups that consist of
applications, health checks and dependency checks.

Riffol uses the unified configuration model from
https://github.com/riboseinc/event-configuration-models for its
configuration syntax definition, startup configuration and
also runtime configuration.

Riffol is implemented in Rust.

== Configuration

=== Init

The main configuration to create application groups:

[source]
----
init "name" {
  application_groups = [
    "applicationgroup.name"
  ]
}
----

E.g.:

[source]
----
init "web" {
  application_groups = [
    "applicationgroup.webstack"
  ]
}
----

=== Application Group

The entered entries in the `applications[]` list is also the order in which applications should be started.

[source]
----
application_group "name" {
  applications = [
    "application.name"
  ]
  dependencies = [
    "dependency.name"
  ]
}
----

E.g.:

[source]
----
application_group "webstack" {
  applications = [
    "application.db",
    "application.www"
  ]
  dependencies = [
    "dependency.webstackdependencies"
  ]
}
----

=== Application

[source]
----
application "name" {
  exec = "string"
  dir = "string"
  start = "string"
  stop = "string"
  restart = "string"
  stdout = "string"
  stderr = "string"
  uid = int
  gid = int
  healthchecks = [
    "healthcheck.name"
  ]
  healthcheckfail = "string"
}
----

E.g.:

[source]
----
application "www" {
  exec = "/etc/init.d/http"
  dir = "/var/www"
  start = "start"
  stop = "stop"
  restart = "restart"
  stdout = ""
  stderr = ""
  uid = 0
  gid = 0
  healthchecks = [
    "healthcheck.www"
  ]
  healthcheckfail = "restart"
}
----

=== Health Check

[source]
----
healthcheck "name" {
  checks = [
    "key://value"
  ]
  interval = int
  timeout = int
}
----

There are several `checks` classes:

. `df`, disk free space
. `proc`, process name
. `tcp`, TCP connection
. `udp`, UDP connection
. `http`, establish a http connection
. `https`, establish a https connection

Parameters:

. `interval`, the interval of the check defined in seconds
. `timeout`, the timeout of network connections defined in seconds

E.g.:

[source]
----
healthcheck "db" {
  checks = [
    "df:///var/lib/mysql:512"
    "proc://mysqld",
    "tcp://127.0.0.1:3306"
  ]
  interval = 60
  timeout = 10
}
----

=== Dependency

A `packages[]` dependency is checked via an operating system specific method.

e.g.: on RHEL/CentOS Riffol will execute `rpm -q ${name}`

[source]
----
dependency "name" {
  packages = [
    "string"
  ]
}
----

E.g.:

[source]
----
dependency "webstack" {
  packages = [
    "httpd",
    "mariadb"
  ]
}
----


=== Resource Limits

[source]
----
limits "name" {
  max_procs = int
  max_mem = int
}
----

e.g.:

[source]
----
limits "db" {
  max_procs = 4
  max_mem = 1024
}
----


=== Redirection and stream destination

[source]
----
stream_destination "rsyslog" {
  encoding = "UTF"
  host = "192.168.1.3"
  port = 514
  protocol = "udp"
}

stream_destination "logfile" {
  encoding = "UTF"
  file = "/var/log/mylogs"
}

application "www" {
  ...
  stdout = "${stream_desination.logfile}"
  stderr = "${stream_desination.rsyslog}"
  ...
}
----

== ... Riffol?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmon_run#The_spawning

> The eggs of a female salmon are called her roe. To lay her roe, the female salmon builds a **spawn**ing nest, called a redd, in a riffle with gravel as its streambed. A **riffle** is a relatively shallow length of stream where the water is turbulent and flows faster.

By spelling "riffol" with an O, we are putting the chemical symbol for oxygen in the word: we are https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox[oxidising] Riffol. Which makes sense, since Riffol is in Rust.
